My research focuses on computational detonation, with an emphasis on the following areas:

(Detonation physics)
1. Three-dimensional effects
1. Rotating detonation waves
1. Shock-bubble interaction
1. Re-initiation after diffraction
1. Vibrationally non-equilibrium

(Scientific computing)
1. High-performance computing
1. Adaptive mesh refinement
1. Numerical methods

(Other)
1. Micro flapping vehicles
1. Particle image velocimetry
